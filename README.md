# Idris Hash Array Mapped Tries

[Bagwell's Ideal Hash Tries](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.21.6279) for Idris.

Without real arrays at this point (as those are not currently supported by Idris) but already slightly faster than Idris SortedSet.

## Run a simple benchmark comparing it to Idris SortedSet implementation

3.1 Search for a key Map Hash Array Mapped Trie (HAMT)

Compute a full 64 bit hash for the key, take the most significant t bits and use 
them as an integer to index into the root hash table. One of three cases may be 
encountered:
 1) The entry is empty indicating that the key is not in the hash tree. 
 2) The entry is a Key/Value pair and the key either matches the desired key 
    indicating success or not, indicating failure. 
 3) The entry has a 32 bit map sub-hash table and a sub-trie pointer, Base, that 
    points to an ordered list of the non-empty sub-hash table entries.

Take the next 5 bits of the hash and use them as an integer to index into the bit Map. 
If this bit is a zero the hash table entry is empty indicating failure, 
otherwise, itâ€™s a one, so count the one bits below it using CTPOP and use the result 
as the index into the non-empty entry list at Base. This process is repeated taking 
five more bits of the hash each time until a terminating key/value pair is found or 
the search fails. Typically, only a few iterations are required and it is important 
to note that the key is only compared once and that is with the terminating node key.

3.2 Insertion
The initial steps required to add a new key to the hash tree are identical to the search. 
The search algorithm is followed until one of two failure modes is encountered.

Either an empty position is discovered in the hash table or a sub-hash table is found. 
In this case, if this is in the root hash table, the new key/value pair is simply substituted 
for the empty position. However, if in a sub-hash table then a new bit must be added to the 
bit map and the sub-hash table increased by one in size. A new sub-hash table must be 
allocated, the existing sub-table copied to it, the new key/value entry added in sub-hash 
sorted order and the old hash table made free.

Or the key will collide with an existing one. In which case the existing key must be 
replaced with a sub-hash table and the next 5 bit hash of the existing key computed. 
If there is still a collision then this process is repeated until no collision occurs. 
The existing key is then inserted in the new sub-hash table and the new key added. Each 
time 5 more bits of the hash are used the probability of a collision reduces by a factor 
of 1 . Occasionally an entire 64 bit hash may be consumed and 64 a new one must be computed 
to differentiate the two keys.
